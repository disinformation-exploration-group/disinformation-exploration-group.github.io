# Fake News

## About ##

Fake news have become our reality. The goal of our project is to fight with disinformation in polish electronic media. We want to improve consciousness of our society by suggesting articles treating the same situation but from a different point of view, and examining the spread of unreliable/controvesial information.


## Idea ##

* Recognition of articles describing same events
* Recognition of controversy among articles
* Presentation of news treating same event but from different (extreme) perspective

## Authors ##

* Tomasz Pastusiak
* Piotr Macek
* Jacek Caban
* Leszek Kawecki
